## Connect to Git

It is possible to connect this project folder to the new repository. For example for GitHub:

1. Create new GitHub repository at https://github.com/new

2. Initialize Git. In terminal run:

   ```
   git init
   ```

3. Add remote origin. Replace $USERNAME and $REPOSITORY with your GitHub username and newly created repository name:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/$USERNAME/$REPOSITORY.git
   ```

That is all, after that you can track, commit and push/pull to repo, for example:

```
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin master
```
